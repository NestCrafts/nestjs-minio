an example JavaScript program. For a complete list of APIs and examples, please take a look at the JavaScript Client API Reference documentation.\nThis document assumes that you have a working nodejs setup in place.\nInstallation\n$ npm i --save nestjs-minioDownload from NPM\nnpm install --save nestjs-minioInitialize MinIO Client\nYou need five items in order to connect to MinIO object storage server.\n\n\n\nParams\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nendPoint\nURL to object storage service.\n\n\nport\nTCP/IP port number. This input is optional. Default value set to 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPs.\n\n\naccessKey\nAccess key is like user ID that uniquely identifies your account.\n\n\nsecretKey\nSecret key is the password to your account.\n\n\nuseSSL\nSet this value to 'true' to enable secure (HTTPS) access\n\n\n\nProvide the credentials for minio module by importing it as :\nimport { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { NestMinioClientController } from './nest-minio-client.controller';\nimport { NestMinioModule } from '../nest-minio.module';\n\n@Module({\n  controllers: [NestMinioClientController],\n  imports: [\n    NestMinioModule.register({\n      endPoint: 'play.min.io',\n      port: 9000,\n      useSSL: true,\n      accessKey: 'Q3AM3UQ867SPQQA43P2F',\n      secretKey: 'zuf+tfteSlswRu7BJ86wekitnifILbZam1KYY3TG',\n    }),\n  ],\n})\nexport class NestMinioClientModule {}\n\n});Then you can use it in the controller or service by injecting it in the controller as:\n\n constructor(@Inject(MINIO_CONNECTION) private readonly minioClient) {}\nQuick Start Example - File Uploader\nThis example program connects to an object storage server, makes a bucket on the server and then uploads a file to the bucket.\nWe will use the MinIO server running at https://play.min.io in this example. Feel free to use this service for testing and development. Access credentials shown in this example are open to the public.\n\nimport { Controller, Get, Inject } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { MINIO_CONNECTION } from '../constants';\n\n@Controller()\nexport class NestMinioClientController {\n  constructor(@Inject(MINIO_CONNECTION) private readonly minioClient) {}\n\n  @Get()\n  index() {\n    const file = '/tmp/app.zip';\n\n    const metaData = {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream',\n      'X-Amz-Meta-Testing': 1234,\n      example: 5678,\n    };\n    // Using fPutObject API upload your file to the bucket europetrip.\n    this.minioClient.fPutObject(\n      'europetripxxx3',\n      'app.zip',\n      file,\n      metaData,\n      function(err, etag) {\n        if (err) {\n          return console.log(err);\n        }\n        console.log('File uploaded successfully.');\n      },\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
